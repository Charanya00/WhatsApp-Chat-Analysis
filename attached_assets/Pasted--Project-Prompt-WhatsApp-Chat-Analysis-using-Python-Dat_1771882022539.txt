📌 Project Prompt: WhatsApp Chat Analysis using Python & Data Science

Prompt:

Build a complete end-to-end Data Science project titled "WhatsApp Chat Analysis & Visualization System" using Python.

The system should allow users to upload exported WhatsApp chat (.txt file) and perform advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) with meaningful visualizations and insights.

The project must include the following features:

🔹 Data Preprocessing

Clean and structure raw WhatsApp chat text

Extract date, time, sender name, and message

Handle multimedia messages and deleted messages

Convert timestamps into proper datetime format

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Total messages sent

Most active user

Most active day and month

Busiest hour of the day

Word frequency analysis

Most common emojis

Most common words (excluding stopwords)

🔹 Advanced Insights

Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral)

Conversation trend over time

Message response time analysis

User interaction heatmap

Most used emojis per user

🔹 Visualizations

Line charts (message timeline)

Bar charts (most active users)

Word cloud visualization

Emoji frequency chart

Calendar heatmap

🔹 Technologies to Use

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

WordCloud

NLTK or TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)

Streamlit (for web app interface)

🔹 Final Output

A user-friendly Streamlit dashboard

Clean UI to upload chat file

Interactive graphs and downloadable insights

🔹 Bonus Features

Compare two users

Detect peak argument days (based on negative sentiment spikes)

Create relationship score based on interaction frequency

The final system should be interactive, visually appealing, and capable of generating meaningful social insights from raw WhatsApp conversations.
